# hyprland-dots
Hyprland installation with Hyde and my dotfiles.

# Changes to HyDE:
- No fish/eza/zsh/starship/lsd/oh-my-zsh
- will not change GRUB or systemd boot
- will not modify pacman.conf
- clocks are set to 24h instead of 12h
- both sddm themes, Candy and Corners, are installed but user can still choose which theme to use by default.
